# Yamod - yet another Jamod

### What is this library for

It's like jamod, but:
- added RTU over TCP mode;
- Added support for Android. Now you can communicate with your devices via Modbus via a smartphone via OTG using
  "usb serial connection". In general, everything related to Android, see the prefix "usb".

All Jamod documentation remains valid, check them out on Sourceforge.
